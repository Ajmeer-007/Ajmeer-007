Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:


The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns."
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
concept:
in the linked list we connot get the memmory address of the two LL if we use while loop at the same time.
for instead we need to maek sure that the both list are travel thrugh the same length. if we do then we can get the answer
for that we need to merge the one LL to other LL if we found the null else move to next node.
finally we need to check the node it self not value or the next node.
return the node not the value.
